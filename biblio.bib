Previous hash-based signatures are facing a loss of security, linear in performance parameters such as the total tree height. Our new scheme can achieve the same security level but using hash functions with a smaller output length, which immediately leads to a smaller signature size. The same techniques also apply directly to the recent stateless hash-based signature scheme SPHINCS (Eurocrypt 2015), and the signature size is reduced as well.},

We provide a constructive proof of a generalization of this theorem which shows the connection between the shape of the isogeny and the simple action of the point                                                                                   {\$}{\$}(0,0){\$}{\$}                  . This generalization removes the restriction of a cyclic kernel and allows for any separable isogeny whose kernel does not contain                                                                                   {\$}{\$}(0,0){\$}{\$}                  . As a particular case, we provide efficient formulas for 2-isogenies between Montgomery curves and show that these formulas can be used in isogeny-based cryptosystems without expensive square root computations and without knowledge of a special point of order 8. We also consider elliptic curves in triangular form containing an explicit point of order 3.},

The formula lends itself to a simple and compact algorithm that can efficiently compute any low odd-degree isogenies inside the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key exchange protocol. Our implementation of this algorithm shows that, beyond the commonly used 3-isogenies, there is a moderate degradation in relative performance of                                                                                   {\$}{\$}(2d+1){\$}{\$}                                                                                            (                          2                          d                          +                          1                          )                                                                                    -isogenies as d grows, but that larger values of d can now be used in practical SIDH implementations.},
